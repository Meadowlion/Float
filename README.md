# LMToolkit
This pipeline is only for Linux due to its reliance on Flye and the GPU Based Version of ONT's Guppy.
This is just small command line pipeline to simplify going from ONT Unbasecalled data using Guppy to Assembly using Flye, all of the tools are existing tools and they are required prior to use of this pipeline!
